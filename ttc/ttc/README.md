# Typethon Compiler 

This is a compiler written in C# which will implement our custom language Typethon.
Typethon is a strongly-typed language with bracketed delimiters. 

### REPL 
the first stage of this project involves implementing a basic lexical analyzer 
and parser, as well as a REPL for quick evaluation.
